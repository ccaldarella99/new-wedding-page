					<h2 class="h-center last"> How they met </h2>
					<p class="first">
						Back in the fall of 2012, Glenn started working as a hostess at Elway's in the Ritz Carlton downtown where Chris had been working as a cook for four years. 
					</p>
					<p class="last">
						Glenn was preparing the host stand for a busy night when Chris came out to ask her about reservations for that evening. Chris immediately caught Glenn's eye with his very healthy mustache that would put Burt Reynolds to shame. After finding out Chris was also a bass player in a local band, it was a done deal.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="proposal">
					<h2 class="h-center">The Proposal</h2>
					<p> 
						Glenn and Chris may not completely agree on how this went down. Mainly because Chris was so nervous and Glenn blacked-out for a minute when she realized what was happening. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In July 2016, Chris and Glenn took a trip to Maine to visit Glenn's family. After the first day, Chris kept asking Glenn to make sure they would have a day to themselves checking out Glenn's favorite parts in the area. July 8th was a rainy, foggy day, but Chris was determined to start the day hiking around Mackworth Island. That should have been Glenn's first clue. If you know Chris, that sounds like one of the last things he would willingly do. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We started the day at Mackworth Island, then headed over to Portland Headlight, grabbed lobster rolls at a diner, then finished the day at Scarborough Beach. Glenn grew up going to Scarborough beach not just in the summers, but year round. Needless to say, Glenn had a lot of great memories on that beach. 
					</p>
					<p class="last">
						After walking down the beach for a bit, Chris started to get down on one knee. Glenn started to try and help Chris help since she thought he was hurt. After realizing that was not the case, Chris very nervously asked Glenn to marry him and according to Chris, Glenn just stared at him with a terrified look. This is probably when Glenn blacked out. After finally snapping out of it, Glenn said "Yes!" while crying. After 15 minutes of crying happy tears and hugging, Glenn finally took a look at the beautiful family ring that came from Chris's grandmother, Rose LoSchiavo. Chris wasn't sure what size ring Glenn was, but when Glenn put it on, it fit perfectly.
